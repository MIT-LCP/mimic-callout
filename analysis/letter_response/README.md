# Response to Drs. Ofoma and Keithireddy Letter

This analysis was done in response to a letter submitted by Drs. Ofoma and Keithireddy about our paper.

The main concern was related to the use of the discharge delay > 24 h exposure.  This work explores the sensitivity of the conclusions to this parametrization fitting natural cubic splines and a more granular binned approach.

They had also request more information about the different groups with longer/shorter discharge delays, and this was actually looked at in our previous output document (../analysis_paper.html), but is repeated here for completeness.
