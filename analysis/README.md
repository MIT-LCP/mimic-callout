# Analysis for Project

This directory contains code and output for the Callout (Discharge Delay) Paper.

Code is in the Rmd file, while the output is in HTML.

the `callout-phi.csv` file referenced in the code is not distributed as part of MIMIC III.  This data is primarily related to the census information.


The CSV files were used to make the table that appear in the paper.  Note P-values of "0" are actually <0.001.
